# RoboAs #19082 Robotics Team Website

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

This repository hosts the source code for the RoboAs #19082 Robotics Team website. The website was built in August 2021 and was gradually updated until the end of the 2021-2022 season, with minor changes regarding team members and sponsors.

## Development

The website was built using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with no frameworks or libraries. The website is fully responsive and was tested on multiple devices and browsers.

Because of the simple website structure, there is no need for a build system or a package manager. The website can be run locally by opening the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Deployment

The website is hosted on Netlify and is automatically deployed when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

You can check out the website at [https://roboas.netlify.app](https://roboas.netlify.app).
